Create a modern dashboard interface that allows users to test website connectivity and view detailed performance metrics. The main screen features a clean, minimalist design with a prominent URL input field and real-time results display.

Central URL testing section with a material-design input field and "Test Connection" button, displaying immediate results with response time and presence score using animated progress indicators
Results card showing success/failure status with color-coded indicators (green/red), response time in ms, and a calculated presence score from 0-100
Recent tests history table below the main testing area, showing timestamp, URL, status, and key metrics with the ability to sort and filter
Responsive layout that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile views
Modern, clean UI with soft shadows, rounded corners, and a light/dark theme toggle
Consider using a loading skeleton while tests are running and smooth transitions between states to enhance user experience.
