Results card showing success/failure status with color-coded indicators (green/red), response time in ms, and a calculated presence score from 0-100
Recent tests history table below the main testing area, showing timestamp, URL, status, and key metrics with the ability to sort and filter
Responsive layout that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile views
Modern, clean UI with soft shadows, rounded corners, and a light/dark theme toggle
